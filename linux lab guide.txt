3.	Working with Stratis in RHEL8 
Note: Before starting the lab – reset the lab snapshot to start of class
3.1 This lab should be run on Server1 as root user
ssh student@192.168.4.3
su -l root
hostname ; echo ; whoami
 
For help on stratis look at the help file
man stratis ; pinfo stratis
 
3.2 Install the stratis stratis-cli packages , enable the Stratisd daemon and start the service
 
yum install stratisd stratis-cli
systemctl enable - -now startisd
systemctl status stratisd
 
Note :  If the package is not getting installed then create this repo file in /etc/yum.repos.d , move other repo files which are present in this folder
 vim /etc/yum.repos.d/os.repo    ----- enter following text
[dvd_baseos]
name=Oracle Linux 8 DVD BaseOS Repo
baseurl=http://192.168.4.1/DVD/BaseOS/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
 
[dvd_appstream]
name=Oracle Linux 8 DVD AppStream Repo
baseurl=http://192.168.4.1/DVD/AppStream/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
3.3 Create a stratis pool on /dev/vdb with name “stratispool1” and list the pool
stratis pool create stratispool1 /dev/vdb
stratis pool list
 
 
3.4 Expand the capacity of the “stratispool1” to use disk /dev/vdc and verify the new pool size
stratis pool add-data stratispool1 /dev/vdc
stratis pool list
 
 
3.5 List the block devices backing the stratispool1
stratis blockdev list stratispool1
 
 
3.6 Add a Thin-Provisioned filesystem “stratis-fs1” on “stratispool1” and mount at “/mnt/stratisvol”
stratis filesystem create stratispool1 stratis-fs1
stratis filesystem list
mkdir -p /mnt/stratis-vol
mount /stratis/stratispool/stratis-fs1  /mnt/stratis-vol
mount | grep stratis-vol
Notice that stratis-fs1 is formatted with xfs filesystem 
 
 
3.7 Verify that thin volume grows when new data is added
stratis filesystem list
echo “This is a Stratis Fileystem – Thin Volume”  >> /mnt/stratis-vol/samplefile.txt
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/mnt/stratis-vol/1GbFile   bs=1M  count=1024
stratis filesystem list
 
 
3.8 Creating a Snapshot on the stratis-fs1 with name “snap-of-fs1”, deleting a file from source and restoring from snap
stratis filesystem snapshot stratispool1 stratis-fs1 snap-of-fs1
stratis filesystem list
rm /mnt/stratis-vol/samplefile.txt
mkdir -p /mnt/snap-stratis
mount /stratis/stratispool1/snap-of-fs1  /mnt/snap-stratis
cat /mnt/snap-stratis/samplefile.txt
 
 
 
3.9 Destroy the Stratis-fs1 , snap-of-fs1 and Remove the Stratis pool stratispool1
umount /mnt/stratis-vol
umount /mnt/snap-stratis
stratis filesystem destroy stratispool1 stratis-fs1
stratis filesystem destroy stratispool1 snap-of-fs1
stratis filesystem list
stratis pool destroy stratispool1
stratis pool list
 
 
 
 
**** Lab Working with Stratis in RHEL 8 Completed ****
 
4.	Checking GRUB2 Config file and modifyingDo boot timer
4.1  This Lab should be run on Server1 as root user
Login to Server1(192.168.4.3) system for this lab


ssh student@192.168.4.3
su -l root
(Enter the password as “Passw0rd!” for root user)
hostname ; echo ; whoami
 
 
4.2 .  Launch the console of Server1 from Virtual Machine Manager  (Keep this open on the background we would need to see this)
 
 
4.3 Run these commands on the ssh console taken on workstation system
 
cat /etc/default/grub
Edit the GRUB_TIMEOUT value to 10 seconds and remove the rhgb and Quite options on GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX
vim /etc/default/grub    
cat /etc/default/grub | grep -E "TIMEOUT|CMDLINE"
grub2-mkconfig > /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
reboot
 
 
 
 
Check the console of server1 taken from Virtual Machine Manager to verify on the boot-timer has changed and boot messages displayed - if need restart again if you missed it.
 
 
 
 
5.	Resetting Root password   (Chapter 18 - Page 416 - Revision 2 Book )
This lab needs to be run on console of Server2  - Take console of server2 from Virtual Machine Manager 
5.1 On system boot, press E when the GRUB 2 boot menu is shown.  (Press Spacebar key to stop the timer)
 
 
5.2. Enter rd.break console=tty1 as a boot argument to the line that loads the kernel and press Ctrl-X to boot with this option.
 
 
5.3. You’ll now be dropped at the end of the boot stage where initramfs is loaded, just before a mount of the root file system on the directory /. Run this command to check sysroot mount as Read-only (RO)
     mount | grep sysroot
 
5.4. Type mount -o remount,rw /sysroot to get read/write access to the system image.
    mount | grep sysroot
5.5 At this point, make the contents of the /sysimage directory your new root directory by typing 
chroot /sysroot
5.6. Now you can enter the new password for the user root using following command
echo "Passw0rd!" | passwd root --stdin
5.7. Because at this very early boot stage SELinux has not been activated yet, the context type on /etc/shadow will be messed up. If you reboot at this point, no one will be able to log in. So you must make sure that the context type is set correctly. 
touch /.autorelabel
exit
exit
 
 
 
5.8 Upon reboot enter the New password for root user  , system might take a minute or two to bootup 
 
 
*** Lab Resetting Root password Complete "
 
 
 
6.	Troubleshooting common boot problems
 
6.1 Exploring Troubleshooting Targets
This lab needs to be run on console of Server2  - Take console of server2 from Virtual Machine Manager 
 
6.1.1. (Re)start your computer Server2. When the GRUB menu shows, select the first line in the menu and press e.
 
 
6.1.2. Scroll down to the line that starts with linux $(root)/vmlinuz. At the end of this line, type 
systemd.unit=rescue.target console=tty1
       Also remove the options rhgb quite from this line. Press Ctrl-X to boot with these modifications.
 
 
6.1.3. Enter the root password when you are prompted for it.
6.1.4. Type systemctl list-units | wc -l   << This shows all unit files that are currently loaded number of lines .
6.1.5. Type systemctl show-environment | wc -l   << This shows current shell environment variables number of lines.
        Type systemctl list-units      << This will list the unit files loaded make note of few
6.1.6. Type systemctl reboot to reboot your machine.
 
 
 
6.1.7. When the GRUB menu appears, press e again to enter the editor mode. At the
end of the line that loads the kernel, type systemd.unit=emergency.target console=tty1
Press Ctrl-X to boot with this option.
 
 
6.1.8. When prompted for it, enter the root password to log in.
6.1.9. After successful login, type systemctl list-units | wc -l . Notice that the number of unit files loaded is reduced to a bare minimum.
 
 
 
 
 
6.2 Repairing File System issues at boot
This lab needs to be run on console of Server2  - Take console of server2 from Virtual Machine Manager 
 
6.2.1  Login as root user, Add this entry to the end of /etc/fstab   << to simulate boot error
cp -v /etc/fstab   /tmp/fstab.bak
echo "/dev/vdxx  /REMOVE-ME   REMOVE-ME" >> /etc/fstab
tail /etc/fstab
systemctl reboot
 
 
 
6.2.2 When the GRUB menu appears, press e to enter the editor mode. At the
end of the line that loads the kernel, type systemd.unit=emergency.target console=tty1
Press Ctrl-X to boot with this option.
 
 
6.2.3. When prompted for it, enter the root password to log in.
mount | grep ro
mount -o remout,rw /
mount | grep root
 
 
vim /etc/fstab 
Comment the line   "/dev/vdxx /REMOVE-me …."
tail -1 /etc/fstab
systemctl reboot
 
 
 
6.2.4  System would boot into the OS - login as root user to confirm on work
 
 
**** This concludes the lab on troubleshooting filesystem issue on boot ****
 
 
7.	Working with Tuning Profile on server 
7.1 This Lab should be run on Server1 as root user
Login to Server1(192.168.4.3) system for this lab
ssh student@192.168.4.3
su -l root
(Enter the password as “Passw0rd!” for root user)
hostname ; echo ; whoami
 
 
For info on Tuned run 
man tuned-adm
tuned-adm --help
 
7.2 Check if Tuned is  installed on server (It probably already installed.)
       yum -y install tuned
       yum info installed tuned
7.3 Type systemctl status tuned to check whether tuned currently is running. If it is not, use systemctl enable --now tuned.
      systemctl status tuned.service
     systemctl enable --now tuned.service
7.4 To see which profile currently is used, type 
       tuned-adm active 
7.5 To see which tuned profile is recommended, type
       tuned-adm recommend 
7.6. To select and activate the throughput-performance profile, type 
       tuned-adm profile throughput-performance.
       tuned-adm active
      tuned-adm recommend
 
 
 
 
8.	Changing nice values of processes 
8.1 This Lab should be run on Server1 as root user
Login to Server1(192.168.4.3) system for this lab
ssh student@192.168.4.3
su -l root
(Enter the password as “Passw0rd!” for root user)
hostname ; echo ; whoami
 
 
8.2 Start a few background process which start using CPU resources
Note: Don't run these commands on a production server as they shoot-up CPU Usage
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/null &
md5sum /dev/urandom &
cat /dev/urandom >> /dev/null &
jobs
ps aux | grep -E "md5sum|cat|dd"
Notice the 3rd Column which shows the CPU usage for the Processes
 
 
8.3 To start a process with a higher nice value - which would assign better CPU resources to this new process
    nice -n -5 md5sum /dev/urandom&
   ps aux | grep md5sum
Notice that new process has a better CPU allocation according to 3rd column
 
 
8.4 To change the nice value of a existing process - we need to renice the process ID
  pgrep md5sum
   renice -n 0  2005
    ps aux | grep md5sum
 
 
8.5 To change the nice values for all the Processes of md5sum
renice -n -5 $(pgrep md5sum)
ps aux | grep md5sum
 
 
Pro-Tip - You may use the top command to check the running process and change nice value of process from there as well
 
**** This Concludes the Day 1 Lab Activities ****
